### Traditional Method

1. *Face Sketch Synthesis and Recognition. (Tang and Wang, ICCV2003)* **The very first paper**  
Key ideas:
    - A new face can be reconstructed from training samples by PCA.
    - The transformation between photo and sketch can be approximated as a linear process.

1. *A Nonlinear Approach for Face Sketch Synthesis and Recognition (CVPR2005)*  
Key ideas: extract images into patches, assume local linearity rather than global linearity
